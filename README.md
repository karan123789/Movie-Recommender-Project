# Movie-Recommender-Project



This movie recommender project harnesses the power of machine learning through libraries like scikit-learn for cosine similarity computations and TfidfVectorizer for feature vectorization of genres, keywords, and tags. Leveraging these tools, the system provides personalized movie recommendations based on users' selected preferences. The project is built upon Python and deployed seamlessly using Streamlit, offering an intuitive and interactive user interface for exploring and discovering a curated selection of movies tailored to individual tastes and interests. This project also selects movies with an relatively good accuracy selecting movies with a good fit to what the user input was.
